# Introduction
 This is a Python Reinforcement Learning project which teaches an AI model to play *Snake*. The game is designed using *Pygame*, the machine learning stuff are coded with *PyTorch*. Also, the tables are drawn using *matplotlib*.
 # How to run the code
 Either clone are downlaod this repo, then run the `agent.py` module. It shall take around 80 to 100 games/cycles until the agent can play the game well (the time needed to do so is something around 10 minutes).<br>
 (The main files you need in order to run the code are `agent.py`, `helper.py`, `model.py`, `snake_game.py` and `arial.ttf`)
