 # How to run the code
 Either clone are downlaod this repo, then run the `agent.py` module. It shall take around 100 to 120 games/cycles until the agent can play the game well (the time needed to do so is something around 15 minutes).Obviously, the more time the agent plays, the better it performs.<br>
 (The main files you need in order to run the code are `agent.py`, `helper.py`, `model.py`, `snake_game.py` and `arial.ttf`)
